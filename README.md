# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Keras
In this project, we will predict diabetes with a neural network model using the Python Keras library. We'll use libraries like seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations, and then evaluate the model.  
This project utilizes a neural network model implemented in Python with the Keras library to predict diabetes in individuals. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which includes features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.
