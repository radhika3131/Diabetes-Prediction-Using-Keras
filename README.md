# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Keras
In this project, we will predict diabetes with a neural network model using the Python Keras library. We'll use libraries like Seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations, and then evaluate the model.  
This project utilizes a neural network model implemented in Python with the Keras library to predict diabetes in individuals. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which includes features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing: 
Handle missing values, and address data skewness and scale features.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualize trends in the dataset, identify correlations, and gain insights into feature distributions.
### Neural Network Model: 
Build a simple neural network using Keras and TensorFlow.
### Model Evaluation: 
Assess model performance using classification metrics and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
